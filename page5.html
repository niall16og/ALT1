                    <h1>Evaluation of Project</h1>
                    <p>
                        If we were to undertake this project again, we would spend more time planning and refining our initial idea, and consider adding a more complex solution. Although we are proud of what we achieved, we believe that better upfront planning could have led to even more impactful results. Our project, which focused on addressing accessibility issues in the home environment using micro bits, was successful in its core goal of contributing to the resolution of these challenges. However, we believe there is potential for further innovation and improvement. Overall, the project was a great learning experience, and we thoroughly enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of working with micro bits. The process was both fun and educational, and it gave us valuable insight into how technology can be used to make everyday life more accessible.

                    <p>
                        Throughout the project, we made several changes to improve the complexity and effectiveness of our solution. We constantly refined our approach, adjusting both the design and functionality to achieve a better outcome. One of the main challenges we faced was the limited power capacity of the micro bits. This meant we had to frequently swap out the micro bits and rethink our power management to ensure the system worked properly.

                        We tried various wiring setups and different boards, but we couldn't find a lasting solution to the power issue. If we were to do this again, we would focus more on fixing this problem by exploring alternative power sources and improving energy efficiency to make the system more reliable and longer-lasting.
